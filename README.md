Data@ANZ is about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo, to deliver on ANZ’s purpose “to shape a world where people and communities thrive”.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.
