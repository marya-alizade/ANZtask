# ANZ Virtual Internship Program

Data@ANZ is about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo, to deliver on ANZ’s purpose “to shape a world where people and communities thrive”.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.

# Data@ANZ Program

Data Science is a contact sport at ANZ - it’s about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo.

We are looking to distill unique insights from the data that will enable us to take action. We want to know “what does all this data actually mean for us and our clients, and what should we do next?”

# First Task : Exploratory Data Analysis

Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.
I completed this task using Tableau. The dashboard is shared here as a PDF file.
